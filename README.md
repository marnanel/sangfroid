Sangfroid is a Python library to read [Synfig](https://synfig.org) documents, in the .sif, .sifz, and .sfg formats. It isn't ready for general use yet.

Development happens [on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/marnanel/sangfroid), but there's also [a github mirror](https://github.com/marnanel/sangfroid).

Currently we're approaching our first pre-alpha release, *[0.1 liverpool](https://gitlab.com/marnanel/sangfroid/-/milestones/1)*.
